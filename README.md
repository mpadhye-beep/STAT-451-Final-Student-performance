## Abstract:

What factors affect a student's grades?

For our final project, we want to answer what factors may contribute to a student's success. We aim to explore how students' studying habits, socioeconomic status, and engagement in school activities contribute to their grades and academic success. The first data set that we found was a Kaggle dataset looking at how several student performance factors impact a student’s final exam score. This dataset is from Kaggle user lainguyn123. It has 19 columns on various factors and a column for the final exam score. There are 6607 rows/records and the columns range from hours studied to final exam scores. These data points will help us to answer the question we are interested in including data on parental involvement and family income as well as motivation level and attendance.


Another dataset that will help us answer this question was found on Kaggle and it looks at two Portuguese secondary schools in two distinct subjects- Portuguese Language and Mathematics. The two datasets were modeled under five-level classification and regression tasks and had 30 columns to emphasize data attributes for student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features. With the additional dataset, we can explore whether the student’s success dataset applies to different contexts and environments. Importantly, we are able to create graphs to display the interactions between the datasets and gain insights. Consequently, we are able to answer the question of the factors contributing to student’s success with the relationships between two datasets.

## Visualizations:

Regarding the file “Distribution-of-exam-scores-in-public-and-private-schools.png”, this visualization aims to determine if students' exam grades are affected by the type of school they attend (public school vs. private school). The visualization shows that the distribution of final exam scores in both types of schools is roughly symmetric, so mean is the best measure of center. Visually, it appears that the mean is about the same for both types of schools, indicating students perform about the same in both environments. The mean, confirmed by numerical summary, falls at about 67% for both schools. The spread is also almost identical, with the highest number of students scoring about 67%, the second highest number of students scoring about 63%, and the third-highest number of students scoring about 74%. The total number of students enrolled in public schools is much higher, so it makes sense that the peak for public schools is higher than private schools. Based on this graph, the data would suggest the type of school does not impact student performance.

Regarding the file "Exam Score by Tutoring Sessions and Parental Involvement.png", the visualization investigates the relationship between tutoring sessions and levels of parental involvement and how they affect students' exam scores. From the visualization, we can observe that exam scores generally do not show a strong upward trend with an increasing number of tutoring sessions. This is due to the relatively stable medians across the different numbers of tutoring sessions. Additionally, we can observe that the red boxes (corresponding to high parental involvement) generally have higher median values, indicating that high parental involvement typically correlates with slightly higher exam scores. Furthermore, we can also observe that the median values of green boxes (medium parental involvement) generally result in lower exam scores regardless of the number of tutoring sessions, suggesting that low or high parental involvement could be superior for results. 

Regarding the file "Plot Hours Studied-Exam Score by Motivation Level.png", the visualization aims to determine how the number of hours studied and students' motivation levels impact their exam scores. From the plot, we can see that generally an upward trend between Hours Studies and Exam Score is visible (for all motivation levels), meaning more hours studied generally results in higher exam scores. We can also see that red dots (high motivation) is associated with a wider spread in exam scores, implying that highly motivated students sometimes achieve high scores regardless of the hours studied. On the other hand, low motivation (green dots) may show an association with lower maximum scores, with most low-motivation students scoring lower compared to their high- and medium-motivation counterparts even with more study hours. Overall, the data suggests that both hours studied and students' motivation level play a role in exam performance, with higher motivation potentially compensating for fewer study hours.
